# Piracy Patrol

**Scan. Report. Reclaim your books.**

Piracy Patrol is a tool for indie authors who are tired of playing whack-a-mole with pirate sites.

This Streamlit app:
- Scans Google for suspicious links to your book
- Flags known pirate domains
- Generates links to report DMCA violations or WHOIS complaints
- Features a Hall of Infamy with repeat offenders

This is part of the **Plot Twists & Pivot Tables** project. Built with coffee, chaos, and Python.
